Q: How does the age of the universe change is the cosmological constant is 
positive compared to the case LAMBDA=0? Can one understand this change from the
differential equation?

The age of the universe increases as a result of a small positive cosmological 
constant. This can be seen from tHe differential equation as it belongs to a 
group of terms that all increase the acceleration of the universe. When the 
cosmological constant is set to zero, the whole term goes to zero.

Increasing the Hubble constant reduces the age of the universe.


Q: Observations show that the age of the oldest stars is around  13Gyr. Which 
of the above cosmologies is this observation compatible?

The only cosmology that can accommodate both the age of these stars, as well as
a period before for the coalescence of gasses to form the stars is  the model 
in which the Hubble constant is 70.0 km/sec/Mpc and the cosmological constant 
is 1.25E-52 per m^2.
